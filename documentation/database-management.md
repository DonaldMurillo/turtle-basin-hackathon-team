# Database Management

This document provides information on managing the database for the BasicStarter project.

## Overview

The project uses PostgreSQL as the database and Prisma as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool. The database schema is defined in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.

## Key Entities

1. User: Represents system users with authentication and role information.
2. ApiKey: Manages API keys for users.
3. File: Stores information about uploaded files.
4. Message: Represents internal messages between users.
5. AuditLog: Keeps track of important actions in the system.
6. Webhook: Manages webhooks for integrations.

## Common Database Operations

### Running Migrations

To apply database schema changes:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### Generating Prisma Client

After schema changes, regenerate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### Seeding the Database

To populate the database with initial data:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

### Accessing the Database

You can use Prisma Studio to view and edit your database:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

## Best Practices

1. Always create migrations for schema changes instead of directly modifying the database.
2. Use transactions for operations that involve multiple database changes.
3. Implement proper indexing for frequently queried fields.
4. Regularly backup your database.
5. Use environment variables for database credentials and never commit them to version control.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Prisma or the database:

1. Ensure your database is running and accessible.
2. Check that your `.env` file has the correct `DATABASE_URL`.
3. Run `npx prisma migrate reset` to reset your database if you're having schema issues.
4. Consult the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/) for more advanced troubleshooting.
